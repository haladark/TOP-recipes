    <h2 class="text">Description</h2>
    <p class="text">While not identical to a pan-fried, breaded cutlet, if you want to 
        eat tender, flavorful chicken with lots of crispy, crunchy bits, then 
        this significantly less-messy method is for you. One of the keys to this 
        technique is to use panko breadcrumbs, which are much larger and more jagged 
        than regular, fine breadcrumbs.</p>
    <p class="text">This method also allows us to introduce some additional flavor, and moisture, 
        thanks to the 'glue' we use to attach the crumbs.</p> 

    <h2 class="text">Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p >
        <ul>
            <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <p class="highlight">For the Garlic Breadcrumbs:</p>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>½ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, finely crushed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped Italian parsley</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            <p class="highlight">For the 'Glue':</p>
            <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>¼ cup chicken broth</li>
            <p class="highlight">For the Optional Pan Sauce:</p>
            <li>⅓ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </p> </div>
    <h2 class="text">Steps</h2>
    <div class="text">
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt, black pepper, 
                and cayenne.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over high heat. 
                Add chicken breasts. Sear, untouched, until bottoms release from 
                the pan, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook for 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Add butter and let melt. Add panko 
                bread crumbs. Cook and stir until breadcrumbs start to turn golden, 
                2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, 
                about 1 minute. Turn off heat and add parsley and Parmigiano-Reggiano. 
                Set breading aside.</li>
            <li>Combine mayonnaise, balsamic vinegar, and Dijon mustard in a small 
                bowl. Spread 'glue' over the top and sides of the chicken breasts. 
                Spoon over the the breadcrumb mixture. Use a spatula to transfer 
                chicken breasts back to the skillet. Pour chicken broth around the 
                chicken.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 
                10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the 
                chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
                Transfer chicken to a plate and let rest while you make the 
                pan sauce.</li>
            <li>Pour chicken broth and lemon juice into the pan. Bring to a boil over 
                high heat and add balsamic vinegar. Boil until sauce is reduced, 
                about 2 minutes. Strain sauce and spoon around chicken.</li>
        </ol>
