        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, cream together butter and white sugar 
                    until smooth. Mix in 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. 
                    Mix in flour until dough comes together. Roll dough 
                    into 1 1/2 inch balls, and place on ungreased cookie sheets. 
                    Make a small hole in the center of each ball, using your thumb 
                    and finger, and fill the hole with preserves.</li>
                <li>Bake for 14 to 18 minutes in preheated oven, or until lightly 
                    browned. Let cool 1 minute on the cookie sheet.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the confectioners' sugar, 
                    3/4 teaspoon almond extract, and milk until smooth. 
                    Drizzle lightly over warm cookies.</li>
            </ol>
